Pilots train for years before flying commercially.

When they finally do, most of the flying is done by autopilot. That reduces human mistakes and saves lives. It also means the pilot isn't practicing his skills as much.

Autopilot can fly the plane in many situations, but when things get rough it turns to the human pilot. When that happens, it can be the case that the pilot is underprepared. You see, he hasn't been practicing piloting that much lately.

Do you see where this gets?

To maintain a skill honed you need to use it constantly. When automation enters the scene it relieves you from having to perform that skill. With less practice, you get out of shape. Instead of being relieved by automation you start being replaced by it.

That is good when automation replaces low skilled labor. But what happens when automation replaces essential skills or creative work?

Gmail completes sentences for you. Stating it differently: Gmail uses artificial intelligence to automate writing by completing sentences. You can think it's ok for you. After all, you have written stuff your entire life. It's just helping you out.

What about the next generations? They communicate heavily through messaging. Will they relly on automatically generated text to a point where they depend on it? 

Remember that when you let something perform a skill for you, you've outsourced that skill. When you outsource it, you eventually lose the ability to do it. And most important: you become dependent on your source.

It's not hard to imagine a future where people depend on assistance for writing to a point that they can't communicate without help.

It gets worse if you think that by suggesting your sentences, they manipulate what you say. And you will be too stupid to understand.

We've been talking about this on the individual level. Now imagine this happening to entire populations. Entire populations manipulated. That's a lot of power for who controls the AI.

This reflection also made me question: what essential skills have I outsourced without being aware?
